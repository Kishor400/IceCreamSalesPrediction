<h3>Linear Regression Algorithm :</h3>

<p>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). The goal is to find the best-fit linear equation that describes the relationship between the variables. </p>

<h3>Simple Linear Regression :</h3>

<p>In Simple Linear Regression,  It has 1 dependent variable and 1 independent variable.</p>

<p>Formula : y = b0 + b1*x</p>

<p>b0 = Intercept</p>
<p>b1 = Coefficient of x</p>
